# Indian General Elections 2024 Analysis

### Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 Indian General Elections. The primary aim was to gather insights on the election results using SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to derive and visualize various metrics, such as state-wise seat allocation. The project highlights key analytical and visualization skills applied to real-world datasets.

### Project Objectives
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Cleaned raw datasets using SQL and Excel to ensure data accuracy and usability.
- **Data Integration**: Imported cleaned tables into MySQL Workbench, connecting them using SQL queries for efficient data operations.
- **Insights Generation**: Performed data analysis to derive meaningful insights, such as state-wise seat distribution, using MySQL.
- **Data Visualization**: Created various visualizations, including bar graphs, donut charts, and hierarchical diagrams using Tableau and Power BI, to illustrate key findings.

### Tools & Technologies
- **SQL/MySQL Workbench**: Data cleaning, querying, integration, and analysis.
- **Excel**: Data preprocessing and additional data cleaning.
- **Tableau & Power BI**: Data visualization, hierarchical diagram creation, and insights presentation.

### Process
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Cleaned raw datasets in **SQL** and **Excel**, preparing data for further analysis.
  
2. **Data Integration in MySQL Workbench**:  
   - Imported tables and connected them via SQL queries to build relationships and perform advanced data operations.

3. **Data Analysis**:  
   - Executed SQL queries to derive insights, such as **state-wise seat allocation** and **party distribution across regions**.
  
4. **Data Visualization & Hierarchical Diagram**:  
   - Created a **hierarchical diagram in Tableau** for a structured view of election data.
   - Developed visualizations in **Power BI** and **Excel**, including bar graphs, donut charts, and others, to communicate data findings effectively.

5. **Documentation**:  
   - Documented all SQL queries, questions, and answers alongside visualizations in a **PowerPoint presentation**.
  
### Key Insights
